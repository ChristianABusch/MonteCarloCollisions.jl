# MonteCarloCollision
This package implements Monte-Carlo collisions for isotropic elastic scattering, excitation of an atom/molecule, backward scattering (charge exchange) and ionization collisions. Explanations for the calculations can be found in "Zoltán Donkó et al 2021 Plasma Sources Sci. Technol. 30 095017".

# API
Let $$\vec{v}_1$$ and $$m_1$$ be the velocity and mass of the scattering particle (electron here) and  $$\vec{v}_2$$ and $$m_2$$ the velocity and mass of the target particle (atom here). $$\vec{g}=\vec{v}_1 - \vec{v}_2$$ is the relative velocity and $$\vec{w}$$ the center of mass velocity. 
The velocities after different types of collisions can then be calculated as:
```julia
v⃗₁′ = isotropic_elastic_collision(g⃗, w⃗, m₁, m₂)
v⃗₁′ = backscatter_elastic_collision(g⃗, w⃗, m₁, m₂)
v⃗₁′ = excitation_collision(g⃗, w⃗, m₁, m₂, E_exc)
v⃗₁′, v⃗_new_electron= ionization_collision(g⃗, w⃗, m₁, m₂, E_iz, Ē[:Ar])
```

The package also includes some helpful functions when working with collisions. The collision probability for a collision of a particle with velocity $v$ with a gas with density $$n$$ and cross section $$\sigma(v)$$ over a time-intervall $$dt$$ is
```julia
P = collision_probability(σ, n, v, dt)
```
When it was determined that a collision occured by evaluating the total cross section, a collision process can be determined by partitioning the interval $$[0,1]$$ into blocks of size $$P_k$$, where $$P_k=\sigma_k / \sigma_{tot}$$. Then a random number is selected and the process into which the random number lands is selected.
```julia
σ = [σ₁, σ₂, σ₃]
i_process = select_collision(σ)
```
